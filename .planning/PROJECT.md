# PiPi (Presentation Intelligence)

## What This Is

A presentation tool for teachers that transforms PDF lesson plans into interactive slideshows with AI-generated content, a teleprompter script for the teacher, and progressive bullet reveal. Teachers upload their existing lesson plans, select student age/grade level, and the AI creates an engaging presentation with speaker notes that guide the teacher through natural, conversational delivery.

**v2.1 shipped:** Added landing page entry point for existing .pipi files (Load button + drag-drop), rebranded from LessonLens to PiPi with styled header, illustrated logo, and dark mode default.

## Core Value

Students see only the presentation; teachers see the presentation plus a teleprompter script that lets them sound knowledgeable and natural without reading slides verbatim.

### Active

**v2.2 Flexible Upload & Class Bank**

Flexible Upload:
- [ ] Landing page accepts lesson PDF, existing PPT (as PDF), or both
- [ ] AI generates fresh slides from lesson PDF only (current behavior)
- [ ] AI refines/adapts existing PPT to PiPi format (less text-dense, proper structure)
- [ ] AI uses lesson content to improve existing slides when both provided

Class Bank:
- [ ] Save current student list as a named class
- [ ] Load saved class into any presentation
- [ ] Class bank stored in localStorage (persists across presentations)
- [ ] Full class management: view all, rename, edit students, delete

### Deferred (v2.2+)

- [ ] Elapsed time display showing presentation duration
- [ ] Fullscreen recovery (auto re-enter if exited)
- [ ] Setup wizard with screenshots
- [ ] Video walkthrough for API key setup
- [ ] API calls this session counter
- [ ] Auto-save indicator in header
- [ ] Model selection dropdown in settings

### Out of Scope

- Real-time student device sync (each student on their own device) — high complexity, not needed for classroom projector setup
- Cloud storage/authentication — file-based sharing is sufficient for team of 5
- Mobile app — web-first
- Annotation tools / laser pointer — scope creep, PiPi is teleprompter-focused
- Slide transitions / animations — not core to teleprompter value
- Video embedding — storage/bandwidth concerns
- User accounts / login system — colleagues load shared files, no auth needed
- Desktop installer (Electron/Tauri) — GitHub Pages simpler, free, auto-updates
- OpenAI provider support — browser CORS blocked, no workaround without backend

## Context

### Current State

Shipped v2.1 with 6,993 LOC TypeScript.
Tech stack: React 19, Vite, Gemini/Claude API, Tailwind CSS, react-rnd.
Client-side only (no backend).
Deployed at: https://goom1000.github.io/PiPi/

v2.1 delivered Landing Page & Branding:
- "Load Presentation" button on landing page for existing .pipi files
- Drag-and-drop .pipi files on landing page → auto-loads
- Styled "PiPi" header with whiteboard icon (violet/amber theme)
- Illustrated landing page logo
- Dark mode as default, subtle violet light mode background
- Browser tab, favicon, and ResourceHub watermark updated

### Technical Environment

- React 19 SPA with Vite
- Gemini/Claude API for AI generation
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- No backend — client-side only
- CDN-loaded dependencies (PDF.js, PptxGenJS, html2pdf)
- GitHub Pages hosting with GitHub Actions CI/CD

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Must remain a client-side SPA (no server). React + Vite.
- **Browser APIs**: Limited to what modern browsers provide (Window Management API, Presentation API, or fullscreen heuristics)
- **Backward compatibility**: Must not break existing functionality (editing, presenting, quizzes)
- **API providers**: Limited to providers with browser CORS support (Gemini, Claude)
