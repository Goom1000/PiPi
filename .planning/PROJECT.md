# Cue (Presentation Intelligence)

## What This Is

A presentation tool for teachers that transforms PDF lesson plans into interactive slideshows with AI-generated content, a teleprompter script for the teacher, and progressive bullet reveal. Teachers upload their existing lesson plans, select student age/grade level, and the AI creates an engaging presentation with speaker notes that guide the teacher through natural, conversational delivery.

**v3.3 shipped:** Deck-wide Verbosity — teachers select verbosity upfront during upload, can change it globally during presentation mode with confirmation and batch regeneration, and the setting persists in save files with backward compatibility. Deployed at https://goom1000.github.io/Cue/

## Current State

Shipped v3.3 with ~18,345 LOC TypeScript. Added deck-wide verbosity selection (upfront on landing page + toggle in presentation mode) with batch regeneration, progress tracking, cancellation with rollback, and file format v3 persistence. Previous v3.2 delivered pedagogical slide types (Elaborate, Work Together, Class Challenge).

## Core Value

Students see only the presentation; teachers see the presentation plus a teleprompter script that lets them sound knowledgeable and natural without reading slides verbatim.

### Active

(None — next milestone TBD)

### Deferred (v3.3+)

- [ ] Elapsed time display showing presentation duration
- [ ] Fullscreen recovery (auto re-enter if exited)
- [ ] Setup wizard with screenshots
- [ ] Video walkthrough for API key setup
- [ ] API calls this session counter
- [ ] Auto-save indicator in header
- [ ] Model selection dropdown in settings

### Out of Scope

- Real-time student device sync (each student on their own device) — high complexity, not needed for classroom projector setup
- Cloud storage/authentication — file-based sharing is sufficient for team of 5
- Mobile app — web-first
- Annotation tools / laser pointer — scope creep, PiPi is teleprompter-focused
- Slide transitions / animations — not core to teleprompter value
- Video embedding — storage/bandwidth concerns
- User accounts / login system — colleagues load shared files, no auth needed
- Desktop installer (Electron/Tauri) — GitHub Pages simpler, free, auto-updates
- OpenAI provider support — browser CORS blocked, no workaround without backend

## Context

### Current State

Shipped v3.3 with ~18,345 LOC TypeScript.
Tech stack: React 19, Vite, Gemini/Claude API, Tailwind CSS, react-rnd.
Client-side only (no backend).
Deployed at: https://goom1000.github.io/Cue/

v3.3 delivered Deck-wide Verbosity:
- Upfront verbosity selection on landing page before slide generation
- Deck-wide verbosity toggle replaces per-slide selector
- Batch regeneration with confirmation dialog and progress overlay
- Cancellation with rollback to pre-regeneration state
- File format v3 with deckVerbosity field and v2 backward compatibility

v3.2 delivered Pedagogical Slide Types:
- Single teleprompter regeneration with context-aware AI (surrounding slides for flow)
- Elaborate slide insertion (AI generates deeper content with examples)
- Work Together slide insertion (collaborative activities with student pairs)
- Class Challenge slides (live contribution capture with real-time sync)

### Technical Environment

- React 19 SPA with Vite
- Gemini/Claude API for AI generation
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- No backend — client-side only
- CDN-loaded dependencies (PDF.js, PptxGenJS, html2pdf)
- GitHub Pages hosting with GitHub Actions CI/CD

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Must remain a client-side SPA (no server). React + Vite.
- **Browser APIs**: Limited to what modern browsers provide (Window Management API, Presentation API, or fullscreen heuristics)
- **Backward compatibility**: Must not break existing functionality (editing, presenting, quizzes)
- **API providers**: Limited to providers with browser CORS support (Gemini, Claude)
