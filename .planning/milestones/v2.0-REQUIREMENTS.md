## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Cloud storage | File-based sharing sufficient for 5-person team |
| User accounts | No auth needed — colleagues load shared files |
| Desktop installer | GitHub Pages simpler, free, auto-updates |
| Real-time collaboration | Overkill for small team |
| Sharing class lists in .pipi files | Each teacher enters own students |
| Image generation with Claude | Claude doesn't support image gen — falls back to Gemini |
