## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Real-time student device participation | High complexity, not needed for projector setup |
| Actual monetary prizes display | Inappropriate for classroom; use points/stars |
| TV show intro animations/videos | Storage concerns, copyright issues |
| Sound effects | Teacher provides drama verbally per user request |
| Leaderboard persistence across sessions | File-based sharing sufficient |
