- **ADV-04**: Template library for common worksheet types

### Collaboration

- **COLLAB-01**: Share enhanced resources with colleagues
- **COLLAB-02**: Resource library across presentations

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Real-time collaborative editing | High complexity, not core to enhancement value |
| Cloud storage for resources | File-based sharing sufficient for team of 5 |
| OCR/Tesseract.js | Gemini vision superior, avoids 5MB+ bloat |
| Complex layout reconstruction | Tables/columns handled via multimodal AI, not manual parsing |
| Mobile-first resource upload | Web-first, teachers use desktop primarily |
