## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Student self-identification on devices | Not needed for projector setup |
| Question history / analytics | Adds complexity, not core to v2.4 |
| Custom question bank | AI generation is sufficient |
| Voice-based student selection | Scope creep |

## Traceability
