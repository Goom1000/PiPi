## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Real-time student device sync | High complexity, not needed for classroom projector setup |
| Cloud storage/authentication | File-based sharing is sufficient for team of 5 |
| Mobile app | Web-first |
| Annotation tools / laser pointer | Scope creep, PiPi is teleprompter-focused |
| Slide transitions / animations | Not core to teleprompter value |
| Video embedding | Storage/bandwidth concerns |
| User accounts / login system | Colleagues load shared files, no auth needed |
| Desktop installer | GitHub Pages simpler, free, auto-updates |
| OpenAI provider support | Browser CORS blocked, no workaround without backend |

## Traceability
