## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded from v3.5.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| A3 poster size | A4 sufficient for v3.5, most school printers are A4 |
| Print directly (skip PDF) | Browser print from PDF is standard workflow |
| Cloud poster storage | File-based workflow matches existing Cue patterns |
| Poster editing before export | Adds complexity, teachers can edit slides before export |
