# Requirements: PiPi v2.2

**Defined:** 2026-01-19
**Core Value:** Students see only the presentation; teachers see the presentation plus a teleprompter script that lets them sound knowledgeable and natural without reading slides verbatim.

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release.

- Fullscreen recovery (auto re-enter if exited)
- Setup wizard with screenshots
- Auto-save indicator in header

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Cloud-synced class lists | localStorage sufficient for single-device use |
| Import class from CSV/Excel | Manual entry is fine for small class sizes |
| PPT file parsing (native .pptx) | PDF export from PowerPoint is sufficient |
