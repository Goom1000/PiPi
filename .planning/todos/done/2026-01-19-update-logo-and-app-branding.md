## Problem

The current app branding needs a more professional look:
- Logo needs updating to something more polished/professional
- App name in the banner should be updated
- Browser tab title (document title) needs to reflect the new name
- Favicon should match the new branding

This affects:
- Main app header/banner
- Browser tabs when the app is open
- Any student view windows that open
- Favicon displayed in browser

## Solution

TBD — requires:
- New logo asset (user to provide or generate)
- Update favicon (index.html or public folder)
- Update document title in index.html
- Update any hardcoded "PiPi" text in banners/headers
- May need multiple favicon sizes for different contexts
