title: Add varied quiz game formats
area: ui

## Problem

Currently the app has a Kahoot-style game activity. More variety in game formats would make lessons more engaging and fun for students. Teachers want multiple game styles to choose from.

**Requested game formats:**

1. **The Chase** — Based on the TV show format where contestants answer questions while being "chased" by a quiz expert
2. **Beat the Chaser** — Another format from The Chase series with different mechanics
3. **Who Wants to Be a Millionaire** — Classic format with increasing difficulty, lifelines, and dramatic progression

More game variety = more engaging lessons = better student participation.

## Solution

TBD — significant feature requiring:
- Game selection UI (choose which game type to play)
- Individual game components for each format
- Game-specific rules and scoring mechanics
- Visual themes matching each game style
- AI-generated questions adapted to each format
- Student view support for all game types
