# Roadmap: PiPi v2.1

## Milestones

- v1.0 MVP - Phases 1-3 (shipped 2026-01-18)
- v1.1 Draggable Preview - Phase 4 (shipped 2026-01-18)
- v1.2 Permission Flow - Phase 5 (shipped 2026-01-18)

- **v2.1 Landing Page & Branding** - Phases 6-7 (in progress)

## Overview

v2.1 adds two user-facing improvements: a landing page that accepts .pipi files directly (removing friction for users who already have presentations), and updated branding throughout the app (replacing LessonLens with PiPi logo and name).

## Phases

- [ ] **Phase 6: Landing Page** - Load existing presentations from the landing page
- [ ] **Phase 7: Branding** - Replace LessonLens branding with PiPi identity

## Phase Details

### Phase 6: Landing Page
**Goal**: Users can load existing .pipi presentations directly from the landing page without creating a new one first
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v2.1)
**Requirements**: LAND-01, LAND-02, LAND-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User sees "Load Presentation" button alongside PDF upload on landing page
  2. User can click button to open file picker and select .pipi file
  3. User can drag .pipi file onto landing page and it auto-loads
  4. Loading a .pipi file transitions directly to editor with presentation loaded
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [ ] 06-01-PLAN.md - Add Load button and drag-drop hint to landing page

### Phase 7: Branding
**Goal**: App displays PiPi branding consistently throughout all UI elements
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Requirements**: BRND-01, BRND-02, BRND-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Header displays PNG logo instead of "L" icon and "LessonLens" text
  2. Browser tab shows "PiPi" as page title
  3. ResourceHub footer/watermark shows "PiPi" instead of "LessonLens"
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 07-01: Replace LessonLens branding with PiPi
