# Roadmap: Cue v3.0 Quiz Game Variety

## Milestones

- **v2.5 Rebrand to Cue** - Phases 1-19 (shipped 2026-01-23)
- **v3.0 Quiz Game Variety** - Phases 20-26 (in progress)

## Overview

v3.0 transforms Cue from a single-game quiz tool into a multi-game platform with TV show-style formats. The journey starts by establishing a unified game architecture that prevents state silos and code duplication, then proves the framework by refactoring the existing quiz and building the simplest new game (Millionaire). Once patterns are validated, we extend AI generation for game-specific question needs, implement timer-based games (The Chase, Beat the Chaser), add competition modes, and ensure seamless synchronization across teacher and student views.
