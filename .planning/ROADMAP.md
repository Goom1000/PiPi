# Roadmap: Cue v3.6 Tooltips & Onboarding

## Overview

v3.6 adds feature discovery through contextual tooltips and per-screen walkthrough tours. Using driver.js (5kb) and Floating UI (3kb), we implement manual-trigger tours (3-5 steps each) for Landing, Editor, and Presentation screens, plus info icon tooltips explaining complex features. Infrastructure first, then progressive screen-by-screen rollout to avoid tour fatigue.

## Milestones

- v3.5 Working Wall Export - Phases 1-40 (shipped 2026-01-27)
- v3.6 Tooltips & Onboarding - Phases 41-44 (in progress)
