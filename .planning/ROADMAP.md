# Roadmap: v3.5 Working Wall Export

**Depth:** Comprehensive
**Phases:** 3 (38-40)
**Requirements:** 17 total

## Overview

v3.5 enables teachers to select slides from their presentation and export them for classroom display. Teachers can either quick-export slides as-is (preserving class notes) or use AI Poster Mode to transform raw content into polished educational reference materials optimized for wall display.

## Phases

### Phase 38: Slide Selection UI

**Goal:** Teachers can select which slides to export for Working Wall display

**Requirements:**
- SEL-01: Teacher can toggle selection checkbox on each slide thumbnail
- SEL-02: Selected slides show visual indicator (highlight, checkmark, or border)
- SEL-03: Selection count displays when 1+ slides selected
