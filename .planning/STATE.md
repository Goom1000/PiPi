## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Recent decisions for v3.6:
- Using driver.js (5kb) for tours and Floating UI (3kb) for tooltips per research findings
- Per-screen tour pattern (separate tours for Landing/Editor/Presentation) to avoid tour fatigue
- Manual trigger only (no auto-play) to prevent workflow interruption during live teaching
- Z-index 10000+ range for tours: overlay at z-10000, popover at z-10001 (41-01)
- Tooltip color inversion in dark mode: light tooltips on dark bg for better contrast (41-01)
- 200ms hover delay for tooltips to prevent accidental triggers (41-01)
- Tour completion detection: Track step index and only fire onComplete when user reaches last step, not on skip/dismiss (41-03)
- Keyboard navigation: Enable allowKeyboardControl in driver.js for Tab/Enter/Escape handling (41-03)
- Focus indicators: Use theme-aware focus rings (indigo-500 light, amber-500 dark) for keyboard visibility (41-03)
- Tour button visibility: Only on INPUT state (landing page), not EDITING state to avoid clutter (41-04)
- Tour replay behavior: User can restart tour anytime by clicking button, regardless of completion state (41-04)
- Data-tour attributes: Pattern established for element targeting (upload-zone, generate-button) (41-04)

### Pending Todos

See `.planning/todos/pending/` — run `/gsd:check-todos` to review

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 41 considerations:**
- Z-index hierarchy established: Tour overlay (z-10000) above FloatingWindow (z-9999), tour popover (z-10001) above overlay ✓
- Accessibility testing: Verify keyboard-only navigation works with screen readers (NVDA/VoiceOver) - deferred to Phase 44
- Dark mode contrast: Verify tooltip text contrast ratio meets WCAG 2.1 (4.5:1 minimum) - recommend WebAIM testing in Phase 43
- Tour overlay interaction: Verify tooltips remain accessible during active tours - test in Phase 42

**Phase 44 considerations:**
- BroadcastChannel safety: Tours must never sync to student view or corrupt game state
- Context-aware suppression: Disable tooltips during active game state or export process

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-01-28
Stopped at: Completed 41-04-PLAN.md (Phase 41 complete)
Resume file: None

**Next step:** Phase 41 complete. Ready for Phase 42-44 (Tour Content Creation) or other roadmap priorities.
