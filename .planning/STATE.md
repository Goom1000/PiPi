## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**v2.0 Phase 1 Decisions:**
- Use list-models endpoints for API key validation (free/cheap)
- Settings stored globally in 'pipi-settings' localStorage key
- Type guards validate data shape on localStorage read
- Save directly to localStorage before closing modal (race condition fix)

**v2.0 Phase 2 Decisions:**
- Strategy pattern with factory for provider abstraction
- AIProviderError class with error codes for unified error handling
- OpenAI removed from UI (CORS blocked in browser, confusing for users)
- Claude uses claude-sonnet-4-20250514 model for text generation
- Claude image methods return undefined (graceful degradation)
- JSON extraction handles optional markdown code block wrapping
- Settings sync on modal close ensures app state matches localStorage
- Provider passed as prop to child components with onError callback

### Pending Todos

7 pending - see `.planning/todos/pending/`

### Blockers/Concerns
