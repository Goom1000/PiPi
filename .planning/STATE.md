## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Recent decisions for v3.7:
- Use multimodal AI (Gemini/Claude vision) for document analysis, not OCR
- Add mammoth.js for Word support (only new dependency)
- Preserve mode as default to prevent hallucination
- Trust UI (visual diff, edit capability) is critical for teacher adoption
- Default gradeLevel hardcoded to 'Year 6 (10-11 years old)' - UI selector deferred
- Prompt rules apply to slide content only, not speakerNotes (teleprompter remains teacher-facing)
- Rules injected after role description, before mode-specific CRITICAL rules
- Variant slides use hardcoded gradeLevel since they don't receive GenerationInput
- Use existing pdf.js CDN (already loaded) instead of npm installing pdfjs-dist
- DOCX page count estimated from character count (~3000 chars/page)
- Document processors organized in services/documentProcessors/ directory
- UploadPanel always visible in sidebar (not conditional)
- Upload errors routed through existing onError callback
- Gemini uses responseSchema for structured output, Claude uses tool_choice (DEC-44-01)
