## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Summary of key v2.2 decisions (Phase 9):
- Backward compatible signature (string | GenerationInput) for generateLessonSlides
- Shared prompt constants (TELEPROMPTER_RULES, JSON_OUTPUT_FORMAT) for consistency
- Blend mode limited to 5 images per source (10 total) for token safety
- GeminiProvider mirrors Claude prompt structure for consistent behavior
- Refine mode must preserve ALL content (restructure, don't omit) - user decides what to remove

Summary of key v2.2 decisions (Phase 8):
- Green theme for lesson PDF upload zone (existing pattern)
- Blue theme for existing presentation PDF upload zone (new)
- Mode derivation via useMemo (fresh/refine/blend/none)
- Shared processPdf helper with callbacks for code reuse
- Dynamic button labels based on upload mode

Summary of key v2.1 decisions:
- Load button placed left of Generate button (secondary action left, primary right)
- Styled text header branding with whiteboard icon (better theming than logo image)
- Dark mode as default theme (better visual experience)
- Subtle violet light mode background (consistent brand theming)
