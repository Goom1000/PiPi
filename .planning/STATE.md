## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Generic BroadcastChannel hook for type-safe cross-window sync
- Hash routing uses native APIs (no react-router dependency)
- PresentationState includes slides array for full state sync
- Synchronous window.open preserves user activation context for popup reliability
- Fire-and-forget popup - BroadcastChannel handles all sync
- Popup blocked fallback shows copyable URL for manual projector setup
- Cast screen change listener through unknown (Chromium-specific API not in lib.dom.d.ts)
- Use screen.isExtended for permission-free multi-screen detection
- Cache secondary screen coordinates for synchronous window.open usage
