## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

v3.0 key decisions:
- Unified game architecture to prevent state silos (discriminated unions)
- Build Millionaire first (simplest, proves framework)
- Atomic BroadcastChannel state snapshots (no incremental actions)
- Zero new runtime dependencies (React 19, Vite, Tailwind sufficient)

20-01 decisions (Game type system):
- Use discriminated unions with gameType literal for type-safe game state handling
- Keep GameSyncState for backward compatibility until Plan 02 refactoring
- PresentationMessage GAME_STATE_UPDATE now uses unified GameState type
- Discriminated unions pattern: Each game state extends BaseGameState with unique gameType literal for exhaustive type narrowing
- assertNever helper for compile-time exhaustiveness checking in switch statements

20-02 decisions (GameContainer router):
- GameContainer uses exhaustive switch without assertNever in default case (TypeScript non-strict mode limitation)
- QuickQuizGame preserves exact UI from QuizOverlay play mode (Kahoot-style)
- Placeholder games show specific phase numbers ("Coming in Phase N") for clarity
- Shared GameSplash and ResultScreen components serve all game types

20-03 decisions (Game system integration):
- Removed QuizOverlay component entirely, replaced with GameContainer architecture
- Quick Quiz launches with loading state before question generation completes
- Placeholder games show splash screen immediately (no generation needed)
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental mid-game switches
- Game state factories (createQuickQuizState, createPlaceholderState) ensure consistent initial states

21-01 decisions (Millionaire game foundation):
- Money tree prizes and safe havens configured as data structures for 3/5/10 question variants
- MoneyTree component uses flex-col-reverse to display highest prize at top (classic Millionaire layout)
- Safe haven amounts calculated dynamically based on current position

21-02 decisions (Millionaire question display and core game flow):
- Sequential reveal animation uses nested setTimeout pattern for dramatic timing (300ms between options, 800ms before result)
- Question count selection (3/5/10) happens before question generation in modal
- GameContainer extended with Millionaire-specific props for proper handler routing
- Victory detection: currentQuestionIndex === questions.length - 1 AND correct answer
- Game over shows safe haven amount (calculated from passed safe havens)

21-03 decisions (Millionaire lifeline implementations):
- 50:50 eliminates exactly 2 of 3 wrong answers randomly (preserves correct answer)
- Audience poll percentages scale with difficulty: 60-80% correct for early questions, 25-35% for late questions
- Phone-a-Friend AI genuinely reasons about questions (not given correct answer) for realistic gameplay
- AI response varies style randomly (confident, reasoning, elimination, uncertain) with ~15% intentional errors
- Lifeline data persists in state after overlay dismissal for student view synchronization

21-04 decisions (Millionaire student view and celebrations):
- Safe haven celebrations trigger on entering next question after passing safe haven position (avoids disrupting reveal)
- Audio defaults to OFF with visible mute/unmute toggle per classroom needs
- Confetti implemented with CSS animations (zero dependencies, performant, sufficient visual impact)
- Wrong answer shows dramatic overlay with correct answer reveal before dismissing to result screen

22-01 decisions (Game question type system):
- GameDifficulty type uses simple presets (easy/medium/hard) mapping to Bloom's taxonomy levels
- SlideContext captures both cumulative lesson content and current slide for question context
- Stub implementations throw 'not yet implemented' errors for type-safe provider contracts
- Bloom's difficulty mapping: easy=Remember/Understand, medium=Apply/Analyze, hard=Evaluate/Create

22-02 decisions (Gemini game question generation):
- Millionaire uses Bloom's taxonomy for progressive difficulty across question count
- 3-question: 1 easy, 1 medium, 1 hard; 5-question: 2 easy, 2 medium, 1 hard; 10-question: 3 easy, 3 medium, 4 hard
- Chase/Beat the Chaser uses consistent difficulty from BLOOM_DIFFICULTY_MAP
- Content constraint in prompts prevents hallucination (questions only from slides)
- Returns empty array on error - caller (Plan 04) handles retries
