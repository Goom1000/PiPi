# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-25)

**Core value:** Students see only the presentation; teachers see the teleprompter script
**Current focus:** Phase 29 - Single Teleprompter Regeneration

## Current Position

Phase: 29 of 32 (Single Teleprompter Regeneration) ✓
Plan: 1/1 complete
Status: Phase complete, verified
Last activity: 2026-01-25 - Phase 29 executed and verified

Progress: ███████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 25% (v3.2 milestone: 1/4 phases)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Milestones shipped: 11 (v1.0 through v3.1)
- Total phases completed: 29
- Total plans completed: 90
- Total LOC: ~17,000 TypeScript

**v3.2 Milestone:**
- Phases planned: 4 (29-32)
- Requirements: 17 total (REGEN: 3, ELAB: 4, WORK: 4, CHAL: 6)
- Coverage: 100% (all requirements mapped to phases)
- Depth: Comprehensive (4 natural delivery boundaries)

**Recent Milestones:**
- v3.1: 2 phases, 3 plans, 1 day (2026-01-25)
- v3.0: 7 phases, 33 plans, 2 days (2026-01-24)
- v2.5: 1 phase, 2 plans, 1 day (2026-01-22)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- **Phase 29**: Context-aware regeneration with prevSlide/nextSlide - Pattern for natural flow transitions in AI-generated content
- **Phase 29**: Differential cache behavior (Standard clears, variants preserve) - Standard is source of truth, variants are cached derivations
- **Phase 28**: Per-slide verbosity caching with file format v2 - Cache structure exists for v3.2 single regeneration to extend
- **Phase 27**: Three-level verbosity toggle (Concise/Standard/Detailed) - Single regeneration must respect current level
- **v3.0**: BroadcastChannel atomic snapshots for game state - Pattern proven for Class Challenge live sync (Phase 32)

### Pending Todos

12 todos in `.planning/todos/pending/` - run `/gsd:check-todos` to review

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.

**v3.2 Research Context:**
- All 4 phases have HIGH confidence implementation paths (no external research needed during planning)
- Zero new dependencies required (React 19 + existing Gemini/Claude providers)
- Phase ordering optimized: low complexity → established patterns → novel pattern
- Critical pitfalls documented: cache invalidation conflicts, BroadcastChannel race conditions, AI context degradation

## Session Continuity
